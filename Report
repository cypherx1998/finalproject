FINAL REPORT

Introdcution to the business case:
In today's world, in order to setup a business, one of the most important part of research is to find a suitable location.
My code is to help you do just that.


Data Required:
The preliminary task will be to find the popular hotspots around Toronto City. These include Tourist spots, Residential spots, Industrial or Office locations and Business spots for small time businesses. This can be done by a quick Google Search.
That will give us the most popular spots around Toronto, we can also quickly google their Postal Codes.
The data we will be using will be retrieved from Four Square API. 
After processing this data, we will find the most popular types of businesses available in the area.
Since my foursquare account is a free sandbox account, the types of data I can retrieve is restricted to the free regular endpoint options.

Methodology:
The data retrieved from FourSquare API will be scanned to check the occurances of a type of business located in the vicinity of our desired area.
Example: If you wanted to open a coffee shop, we will retrieve the data across the popular location and scan the frequency of coffee shops across the locations. This will help you choose an area which is both popular and has less competition overall by other coffee shops.

Result:
